# Dairy-Milk-Management-System
Dairy Milk Management System application as a part of dbms course project
Dairy Milk management system(a typical cooperative dairy in india) involves around 200 transactions
per center, around 1200*200 transactions per district(with 1200 centers in district). All these
transactions are performed daily at every center and every head office of all centers.
Traditionally these transactions were performed on books by manually adding every entry at every
Stage. In this project we are designing complete system to perform all the daily transactions including
collection and distribution on a daily basis.
